#   ## Case-Based Study Item Generation Prompt

#   Please generate a complete Case-Based Study (CBS) Item for the CBSE format.

#   **Target Details:**

#   - Grade: 8
#   - NCERT Mathematics Chapter/Unit: 1. Patterns in Mathematics
#   - Topic: Patterns in Number

#   ---

#   ## 1. CBS Material Requirements

#   The source material must be an age-appropriate, real-life scenario that applies the mathematical concepts being tested (e.g., geometry, construction, finance, data analysis).

#   * **Content Relevance:** The stimulus must directly reflect the given chapter/topic, serving as a practical representation of the mathematical concept.
#   * **Material Format:** The case/source material must encourage critical thinking by requiring students to synthesize information from multiple input channels, such as **text, images, tables, or graphs**.
#   * **Stimulus Diagram (If Needed):** If the concept hasn't been fully covered in the textbook, include a stimulus diagram (e.g., geometric figures, graphs, charts, 3D objects) to guide students' thinking.

#   ---

#   ## 2. Item Structure and Cognitive Constraints

#   The item must have **three distinct parts (a, b, and c)**, totaling **4 Marks**, and must be in **constructed response** format (not selected response).

#   | Item Part | Marks | DOK Level | Focus / Skill Area | Question Type Expectation | Skills to Cover |
#   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
#   | **(a)** | **1** | **DOK 1 (Knowing)** | Recall, Identify, Order, Compute | Recall or identify a fact, formula, or concept **directly from the context** | Focuses on recall of facts, identifying concepts, recognizing patterns, or recalling relevant formulas |
#   | **(b)** | **1** | **DOK 2 (Applying)** | Formulating, Implementing, Representing | Apply a formula, perform routine calculations, or select the correct method **using data** | Focuses on applying the concept or formula to solve problems, represent mathematical ideas, or compute solutions using basic procedures |
#   | **(c)** | **2** | **DOK 3 (Reasoning)** | Analyzing, Justifying, Integrating | Multi-step reasoning, explanation, or generalization **based on context** | Focuses on multi-step problem-solving requiring justification of answers, analyzing relationships, interpreting results, and drawing conclusions |

#   **Key Constraints:**
#   * Each part must build upon the previous one, progressing in complexity.
#   * Avoid overlap between parts.
#   * **Skill Selection Rule:**  
#     - For **Part (a)** and **Part (b)**, select **only one skill** corresponding to their respective DOK levels (e.g., Identify for DOK 1, Implement for DOK 2).  
#     - For **Part (c)**, integrate **multiple DOK 3-level skills** (e.g., Analyze + Justify or Interpret + Explain) to ensure deeper reasoning and multi-step problem-solving.
#   * Part (c) must align with DOK 3 rigor, requiring **explanation, analysis, or justification** for a deeper understanding, not just substitution or basic calculation.

#   ---

#   ## 3. Output Format Requirements

#   The final generated item must include the following sections:

#   ### 1. Chosen Skill Set

#   * Clearly state the selected cognitive path, with one skill from each DOK level (DOK 1, DOK 2, DOK 3).
#   * *Example: Chosen Skill Set: Identify → Implement → Justify*

#   ### 2. CBS/SI Material

#   * Provide the final, real-life linked source material (text, data, and any relevant description or image/diagram).

#   ### 3. Item Questions (a, b, c)

#   * **Part (a) (1 Mark, DOK 1):** A straightforward question assessing recall or identification from the source material.
#   * **Part (b) (1 Mark, DOK 2):** A question requiring the application of the formula or concept, often involving calculations or representations.
#   * **Part (c) (2 Marks, DOK 3):** A higher-order question that involves reasoning—multi-step problem-solving, justification, or generalization.

#   ### 4. Detailed Answer Key

#   * Provide step-by-step solutions for all three parts.
#   * Clearly explain the solution for each part.
#   * Break down the answer into **value points** for scoring (e.g., 0.5 or 1 mark per point).
#   * **Justify each step in Part (c)**, especially when justifying reasoning or explaining growth patterns or simplifying using mathematical laws.
